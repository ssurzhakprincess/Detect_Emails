Built interpretable ML models to triage cybersecurity email alerts 
by predicting “phishing” labels from email text and noisy LLM-generated 
“soft” features. I worked with a dataset from Proofpoint, focusing on 
the “text” field, the “PHISH-GT” ground-truth labels, and 12 binary “soft” 
label annotations. I compared logistic regression on TF-IDF features 
and decision tree classifiers combining TF-IDF with soft labels based 
on precision, recall, and F1 score. 

This project was completed under mentorship from two Data Scientists 
at Proofpoint. Proofpoint is a leader in providing cybersecurity solutions 
for email, web, and cloud.
